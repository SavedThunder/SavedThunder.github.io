      <h2 class="subHead">About Me</h2>
      <p class="subPassage">I am a third year at the University of Cincinnati enrolled in the College of Engineering and Applied Science in Computer Science. I am an avid reader, and running is my therapy. I have an optomistic, team-oriented, and adaptable personality. My hobbies included movies, music, podcasts, and snowboarding. I love to try new things, especially food. If you would like to learn more about my achievements, passions and endeavors, check out the rest of the page and feel free to contact me for any inquiries. Enjoy!</p>

      <h2 class="subHead">My Passion</h2>
      <p class="subPassage">I am a problem solver by heart. I love the chase of a new puzzle. The thrill of discovering new problems, and solving old problems in new ways is an amazing process. Technology is also a passion of mine. There are constantly new developments in tech that make it an ever-changing field. Having an interest in both of these fields put me in the center for a wide variety of learning opportunities. I hope I can learn to help the world through technology and computer science. I hope to be able to help the world through my passions. </p>

        <p>My C++ experience can be summed up as classwork done in a collaborative environment. Meaning everyone contributed to the goal of finishing each project/lab. The coolest thing we got to work on was our own rendition of a B-Tree template. Go check out the <a href="https://github.com/Evan-Akers/DataStructures/blob/master/Lab10/BTree.h" target="_blank">repository!</a></p>

        <p>One of the coolest things I have done so far was use the Tweepy Twitter API to create a twitter bot. This bot used a Markovian dictionary to store word strings. It was an awesome experience to work on a project that interacted with and collected data from Twitter! Check it out <a href="#" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <p>As for modeling and simulation, I have a plethora of academic experience with MATLAB. One project was calculating the forces acting on plane and submarine doors to tell if they would hold at a certain depth/altitude. Although the coding isn't as rigorous, the engineering behind it is complex.
