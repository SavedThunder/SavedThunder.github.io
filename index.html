I have a passion for technology and building beautful application with code. I have a knack for being creative with everything I do so I can add my own unique touch to the world around me.</br></br><b> I love learning</b> about new ways to interact with technology and improve how I build software applications. I take every opportunity I can to learn from work and school. I thrive in a collaborative environment where ideas flow and grow. I have learned a lot in my academic and professional experience, and strive to continue doing so.<br><br>

I focused heavily on .NET applications that measured the security of ATM processors. I mostly debugged and updated tools and utilities that interacted with the processors. </p>

            <p>My second semester at Diebold Nixdorf I worked again with the Logical Security Team. This semester rotation I was a part of three seperate projects. One project that I worked on was developing features for a company site. The site was built in MVC framework with C#.NET, html, css, and javascript/jquery. Another project was setting up a test environment for new security software on a full ATM. This project let me experience collaborating with other teams. The third project was working with  </p>

        <p>My C++ experience can be summed up as classwork done in a collaborative environment. Meaning everyone contributed to the goal of finishing each project/lab. The coolest thing we got to work on was our own rendition of a B-Tree template.

        <p>One of the coolest things I have done so far was use the Tweepy Twitter API to create a twitter bot. This bot used a Markovian dictionary to store word strings. It was an awesome experience to work on a project that interacted with and collected data from Twitter!

        <p>As for modeling and simulation, I have a plethora of academic experience with MATLAB. One project was calculating the forces acting on plane and submarine doors to tell if they would hold at a certain depth/altitude. Although the coding isn't as rigorous, the engineering behind it is complex.
