                    <h2>Urbanloop | Nancy, France</h2>
                    <h3>Command and Control Developer Intern</h3>
                    <p>I moved to France for 6 months to work at
                        the University of Lorraine on a project
                        called Urbanloop. Urbanloop is a pod-based
                        public transit system designed for individuals
                        to travel short distances.
                        <br><br>
                        I had the opportunity to work on the Stage Master
                        team. I designed and built the concept project. This 
                        concept is a smaller scale model engineered from a 
                        model racecar set and a PLC. The track
                        and switches were connected electronically to 
                        relays addressed on the PLC. From there I was able to
                        write Structured Text code which could then be manipulated
                        through other Python and Ruby scripts.
                        <br><br>
                        The final product included a fully funcitoning track that
                        could be controlled through a GUI, multiple scenario simulations,
                        and a well organized electrical system for the PLC.
