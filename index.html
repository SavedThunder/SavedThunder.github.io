      <h1>It's me Kyle O'Connor</h1>
      <p>Hi, my name is Kyle O'Connor and I am currently in my third year at the University of Cincinati as a Computer Science undergraduate. The computer science program is a part of the College of Engineering and Applied Sceince so it is a 5 year program, and I will graduate in 2020. I have a passion for problem solving and I am constantly hungry to learn. I am an avid runner and I like to think that is where a lot of my discipline comes from. Having to push myself every day, the drive I have for running is the same drive I have for computer science. Academically I am experience with python and C++ with a little bit of Java, Scheme, and Haskell work. I have also taken Data Structures, which was based in C++ and done mostly with Visual Studio 2015. The class consisted mostly of groupwork in labs so we used Github as source control to collaborate outside of class.</p>

      <p>Professionaly, I have had the opportunity to work at a company for two co-op rotations and was able to gain a lot of practical experience.</p>
