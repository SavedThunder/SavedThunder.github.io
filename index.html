I am a currently pursuing my Bachelors and Masters of Science in computer science. I am always trying to learn new things. I have a passion for technology and building meaningful applications with code. I have a knack for being creative with everything I do so I can add my own unique touch to the world around me.</br></br><b> Like I said, I love learning</b>  and finding new ways to interact with technology and improve how I build software. I take every opportunity I can to learn from work and school. I thrive in a collaborative environment where ideas flow and grow. I have learned a lot in my academic and professional experience, and strive to continue doing so.<br><br>
		<b>When I'm not busy learning</b>, I spend my time running, reading, traveling, and playing board games.</h2>

One project that I worked on was developing features for a company site. The site was built in MVC framework with C#.NET, html, css, and javascript/jquery. Another project was setting up a test environment for new security software on a full ATM. This project let me experience collaborating with other teams. The third project was working with  </p>

							<p>This part time internship has shown me the testing side of Software. All of the testing was done on a company website. I used HP-ALM to run tests through servers on VNC Viewer. IBM Raional Doors was a requirement management tool I used to keep track of software requirements. This internship has really given me a deeper look into the testing and requirements side of the software lifecycle.</p>

		<p>My C++ experience can be summed up as classwork done in a collaborative environment. Meaning everyone contributed to the goal of finishing each project/lab. The coolest thing we got to work on was our own rendition of a B-Tree template. Go check out the <a href="https://github.com/Evan-Akers/DataStructures/blob/master/Lab10/BTree.h" target="_blank">repository!</a></p>

		<p>One of the coolest things I have done so far was use the Tweepy Twitter API to create a twitter bot. This bot used a Markovian dictionary to store word strings. It was an awesome experience to work on a project that interacted with and collected data from Twitter!

		<p>As for modeling and simulation, I have a plethora of academic experience with MATLAB®. One project was calculating the forces acting on plane and submarine doors to tell if they would hold at a certain depth/altitude. Although the coding isn't as rigorous, the engineering behind it is complex.
