                    <h4>| January 2019 - July 2019</h4>
                    <p>I moved to France for 6 months to work at
                        the University of Lorraine on a project
                        called Urbanloop. Urbanloop is a pod-based 
                        public transit system designed for individuals
                        to travel short distances.
                        <br><br>
                        I had the opportunity to work on the Stage Master
                        team. I designed and built the concept project. This 
                        concept is a smaller scale model engineered from a 
                        model racecar set and a PLC. The track
                        and switches were connected electronically to 
                        relays addressed on the PLC. From there I was able to
                        write Structured Text code which could then be manipulated
                        through other Python and Ruby scripts.
                        <br><br>
                        The final product included a fully funcitoning track that
                        could be controlled through a GUI, multiple scenario simulations,
                        and a well organized electrical system for the PLC.

                    <h3>Enterprise Developer Intern</h3>
                    <h4>| May 2018 - August 2018</h4>
                    <p>During my time at Worldpay, I was a part of the 
                        Enterprise Data Platform and Tooling team. While on this team I had
                        a few different projects to work on. 
                        <br><br>
                        My first project was instantiating a Business Objects upgrade on a linux server.
                        This entailed a lot of troubleshooting on linux command line and editing 
                        configuration files and batch scripts in order to achieve a stable build. 
                        I collaborated with both my coworkers and SAP in order to solve this problem.
                        <br><br>
                        Anothe project I worked on was the creation of a tool that would pull the location of
                        SQL commands on deprecated tables form MATLAB and SQL scripts. Given a directory where all of 
                        the MATLAB and SQL scripts are held, the program could give file names, line numbers, and the 
                        deprecated table name in an excel document for others to use. This was created to help speed up
                        the Shotgun data ingestion process after the company merger (Vantiv -> Worldpay).
                        <br><br>
                        Lastly, I helped with day-to-day tasks of the team. This included working with SRO for
                        releasing reports into test or production. I provided Business Objects and WebFOCUS Platform
                        development and support. This could be anything from validating new reports to creating new features
                        for users.

                    <h2>Diebold Nixdorf | Canton, Ohio </h2>
                    <h3>Computer Science/Engineering Co-op</h3>
                    <h4>| (August 2016 - December 2016) + (May 2017 - August 2017)</h4>
                    <p>Working for the Logical Security team at Diebold Nixdorf was
                        my first professional experience in computer science. I did two different
                        rotations during my time there. During each rotation I was given different projects
                        to work on with similar technologies.
                        <br><br>
                        The first semester I was working with creating a search and filter features
                        for administrators with token access to the Diebold Nixdorf ATMs. This was done 
                        in C# for the server side and javascript to manipulate data that was populating a table with the
                        information. I also worked with testing user token certificates on different ATM types. I wrote a few
                        batch scripts in order to automate the process of validating the certificates on the machine.
                        <br><br>
                        My second rotation I had three main projects to work on. The first was automating the process of 
                        certificate creation and validation for testing. The process needed to be automated to allow developers
                        to quickly access and test on development and test environments. This shortened the process from three people
                        needing to be involved to one (just the user requesting the certificate). My second project was testing new
                        security software on the configured ATM. This involved making sure all device functionality was intact after
                        installing said software. My third project was building a Windows service in C# for database monitoring. This would 
                        send an email to a user if a specific test/development database was taken offline by another user or was currently
                        unavailable for use.
