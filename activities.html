      <h3 class="subHead">C++</h3>
      <p class="subPassage"> Most of the work I have accomplished in class dealing with C++ has to do with creating data structures. Each lab that was completed was a group project. My github page for this shows all of the contributions that I made to the repository</p>

      <p class="subPassage">One project that was big and I learned a lot from was the twitter bot that we made. It took in tweets from a selected user and mapped the words out in a Markov chain, in the form of a dictionary. It would then generate tweets based on what the user has already said.</p>
