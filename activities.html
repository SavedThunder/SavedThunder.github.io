    	<h3>C++</h3>
    	<p id="actP"> Most of the work I have accomplished in class dealing with C++ has to do with creating data structures. Each lab that was completed was a group project. My github page for this shows all of the contributions that I made to the repository</p>

    	<h3>Python</h3>
    	<p id="actP">Python on the other hand, has a lot of labs and homeworks with completed programs and the solutions I have created have to do with adding on to the created code. </p>

    	<p id="actP">One project that was big and I learned a lot from was the twitter bot that we made. It took in tweets from a selected user and mapped the words out in a Markov chain, in the form of a dictionary. It would then generate tweets based on what the user has already said.</p>
