      <h1>Computer Science/Engineering Co-op</h1>
      <p>   I worked for two semesters starting in the fall of 2016 at Diebold Nixdorf. They are the world's #1 Manufacturer of ATMs. While I was there I worked as a computer science/engineering co-op for the logical security team. My first semester there, I developed and debugged a handful of security testing software. This was done in C#.NET in Visual Studio 2013. I also worked with token certificates and policy files on the processors. I worked a lot with the ATM processors and the security software. Near the end of my first semester there, I built a windows 7 service from scratch. This was in C#.NET and the service was to test database connections for different DBs. If the DB became disconnected it would send an email to the user. With this included integration of an Apache Log4Net logger. This way the user could read logs on top of any information given in the email.</p>
      <p>   My second semester there I developed features for a Admin/Vendor website. This website was built in an MVC style framework. It included C#, html/css, and javascript. I added search/filter features to a data table on the sight. There were different tables with different data on each of the 4-6 pages on each site. I used javascript to manipulate the data in the table, and used html to create the search/filter form for the user. This was one large project that I finished while I was there. Along with that I also tested and set up an ATM with new security software and tested the features of the ATM with different environments. My third running project was working with the policy files and different processor environments. This was a great experience and I developed a lot skills that I know I can use in practical situations.
